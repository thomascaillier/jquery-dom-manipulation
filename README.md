# Jquery 101

> Use CSS selectors with jQuery

You are about to write your first `jQuery` code.

We say that we manipulate the [Document Object Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) (`DOM`), which is
the in-memory representation of the `HTML` built by the browser. It is
a tree (root node, with children, and grand-children, etc.), and
you can:

- Traverse it to read a specific node
- Remove some nodes
- Add some nodes

## TODO

Open the `application.js` file, you will find a list of challenges to complete.

You will see that all results are failing. Solve them from top to bottom,
and hit F5 (Refresh) each time you want to check if you've solved an exercise.
